# SOA-vs-AOS
This program compares the performance of two methods of representing information : 
1) Structure of Arrays
2) Array of Structures

The two representations are implemented for solving the same problem, and the time taken for their execution are compared. In the tested cases, the Structure of Arrays representation outperforms the Array of Structures  representation.
